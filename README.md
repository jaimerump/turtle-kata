# turtle-kata

This is my attempt at solving the kata from Ruby Brigade on 01-20-2015.
See the specification at http://www.puzzlenode.com/puzzles/9-turtle-tracks

You can run it through Terminal by going to the project root and running:

`ruby -r './lib/turtle_kata.rb' -e "TurtleKata.run_with_file('./logo_files/complex.logo') "`

# This class represents a turtle. A turtle is an object that moves around a grid,
# with its movements described as an angle and a scalar.

class Turtle

  # Attributes
  attr_accessor :angle, :position, :step

  # @!attribute [r] angle
  #   The direction in which the turtle is facing, as an angle in degrees.
  #   0 degrees represents the x axis. The turtle starts facing straight up,
  #   so 90 degrees. For the purposes of this project, the angle must be a
  #   multiple of 45 degrees. The angle must be between 0 and 360 degrees.
  @angle

  # @!attribute [r] position
  #   The position the turtle is currently in on the canvas as a Coordinate
  #   Defaults to the center of the canvas
  @position

  # @!attribute [r] canvas
  #   The canvas the turtle is moving across.
  @canvas

  # @!attribute [rw] step
  #   A coordinate representing how far, on each step, the turtle will move
  #   horizontally and vertically based on its current angle
  @step
